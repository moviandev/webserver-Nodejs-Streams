# Nodejs Webserver made with Nodejs API Streams

This is a rudimentary HTTP server based on TCP and some parsing logic, made with some lower-level building blocks such as net, Stream and Buffer. This project is a simpler version of NodeJS HTTP module. 

## Project purposes

This project was 100% focused on my Nodejs studies.
